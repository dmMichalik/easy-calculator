This is easy caclulator i designed for my final project of programing class 

it got custom made eval function that i made myself

it can show steps of the calculations 

it saves your past calculations into a file so you can see them even after you halt program 

it can calculate imaginary numbers too , so if you type into entry 2√-1 you would get 1j

it can even calculate euler's identity which is e**(pi*j) + 1 = 0 

it got a graf maker that i made using mat plot lib and my own eval function 

The design of the buttons did chatgpt cus i suck at making things pretty

I think it´s realy cool project i did
